Workshop announcement:

Shawn Greenlee will be hosting a Code Drop on patching with Pd (Pure Data) to create Digital Music Instruments (DMIs). Come learn about programming and designing computer-based systems for sound art and music performance. Shawn will go over the basics of Pd, an open source visual programming language; and focus on the development of instruments that feature real-time gestural control of sound synthesis and signal processing parameters.

To participate: download and install Pd-extended (http://puredata.info) and bring your laptop to the Code Studio meeting on October 8, 6:30PM at RISD CIT 213. The Code Studio will provide some Livid Brain Jr. USB MIDI boards to experiment with during the session.
