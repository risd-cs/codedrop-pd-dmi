#X text 66 36 Pd (Pure Data) is a visual programming language \, sometimes
called a dataflow language. It allows you patch together "objects"
into your own programs. Each object is a bit of C code. When patching
\, you only need to worry about the input and output of these objects
(which we could also call functions).;
#X text 534 203 There are hundreds of objects in the popular distribution
of Pd \, known as Pd-extended. You can even code objects yourself (mostly
in C \, but Lua is a cool alternative that can be used for some kinds
of objects). You can also create your own libraries of "abstractions"
which are sub-patches you plan to use alot. These work like objects
\, but are created with Pd. More later.;
#X text 114 416 Pd runs in "real-time \, " meaning that you do not
need to compile the program for it to run - it's always "on". In Pd
you can be in one of two modes: edit or run/execute (which I usually
call "play" mode).;
#X text 415 566 Pd was created by Miller Puckette in the mid-90s \,
as an open source project. It is a part of a family of patcher programming
languages \, the most famous of which is it's commercial cousin Max/MSP.
Notably \, Miller is the author of the original Max program developed
in the 1980s. The program 'Max' was named Max Mathews . Max Mathews'
Music N languages were the basis for many of today's computer music
programming languages.;
