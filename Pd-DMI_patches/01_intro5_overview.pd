#X text 429 62 "An instrument that uses computer-generated sound can
be called a digital music instrument (DMI) and consists of a control
surface or gestural controller \, which drives the musical parameters
of a sound synthesizer in real time." (Miranda and Wanderley. 2006
New Digital Musical Instruments. A-R Editions \, Inc.);

#X text 650 761 PLUG - I'll be teaching a Wintersession course called
\; Programming Sound: Performance Systems (IDISC-1528) \; The course
will feature Pd and the Livid board \; 5-weeks to build DMIs with a
concert at the end!;
#X text 586 565 Part 3: Putting the two together with MIDI + highlights
from s3g_Pd abstractions if time \; (~15 min.);
#X text 270 387 Part 1: Up and running with Pd \, audio fundamentals
\, building a synthesizer together \; (~30 min.);
#X text 454 466 Part 2: Livid board overview \, resetting to defaults
\, connecting buttons \, pots \, sensors \, LEDs \; (~15 min.);
#X text 145 216 This workshop will be a fast introduction to DMI design.
We'll be building a fairly simple synthesizer and electronic circuits
that will let us map gestural control to changes in sound. Mainly we're
focussing on NOT using off-the-shelf MIDI interfaces (like keyboards
or knob controllers) \, but everything discussed will apply to them.
