#X text 429 62 "An instrument that uses computer-generated sound can
be called a digital music instrument (DMI) and consists of a control
surface or gestural controller \, which drives the musical parameters
of a sound synthesizer in real time." (Miranda and Wanderley. 2006
New Digital Musical Instruments. A-R Editions \, Inc.);

#X text 624 730 PLUG - I'll be teaching a Wintersession course called
\; Programming Sound: Performance Systems (IDISC-1528) \; The course
will feature Pd and the Livid board \; 5-weeks to build DMIs with a
concert at the end!;
#X text 145 216 This workshop will be a fast introduction to DMI design.
We'll be building a fairly simple synthesizer and (time-permitting)
electronic circuits that will let us map gestural control to changes
in sound. Mainly we're focussing on NOT using off-the-shelf MIDI interfaces
(like keyboards or knob controllers) \, but everything discussed will
apply to them.;
